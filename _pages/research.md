Abstract: <em>We study how overcrowding in maternity wards influences concurrent birth outcomes and mothers' future fertility and hospital choices by leveraging day-to-day fluctuations in birth counts within Californian hospitals. We find a notable reduction in procedure use—C-sections, epidurals, inductions, and augmentations—on crowded days, without compromising maternal or infant health. Despite null effects on future fertility, mothers—particularly non-Black, more educated, and those in less deprived counties—are more likely to switch hospitals or to a non-hospital setting for their next birth. We do not find specific patterns in choice of subsequent hospitals, attributing the decision to negative first-birth experiences.</em>
