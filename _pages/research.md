  <p align="justify">
Our paper examines how overcrowding in maternity wards influences concurrent birth outcomes and mothers' future fertility and hospital choices. We leverage day-to-day fluctuations in birth counts at Californian hospitals as a proxy for overcrowding. We find a notable reduction in the use of procedures such as C-sections, epidurals, inductions, and augmentations on crowded days, without compromising maternal or infant health. While there is no effect on future fertility, mothers—particularly non-Black, more educated, and those in less deprived counties—are more likely to switch hospitals or to a non-hospital setting for their next birth after experiencing overcrowding. We do not find specific patterns in their choice of subsequent hospitals, attributing the decision to negative first-birth experiences.
